          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p style="font-size: larger;">
            I still remember my first hackathon in high school when I learned
            HTML and CSS and scrapped together a static web page for my project.
            Over the next several years I continued exploring web development
            and now have experience building responsive UIs with React, setting
            up backend services with Express and Node.js, and handling an
            applications database with MongoDB. I love exploring new JS
            frameworks and design frameworks for React and have recently been
            exploring NextJS and Material UI. I'm always reading articles,
            watching certain YouTubers (Travesty Media, Ben Awad, etc.), and in
            general try my best to stay caught up with the web development
            community.

          <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
          <p style="font-size: larger;">
            My interest in this field of started at the beginning of this year
            when I sat in on the lectures of SJSU's machine learning class. Here
            I learned about the current applications and future potentials of
            machine learning, the mathematical foundations behind it, and how to
            design neural networks and tune different deep learning models. Over
            the summer I further reinforced my conceptual knowledge and learned
            more about different fields of deep learning. Right now, I’m
            currently working through a Tensorflow 2.0 course on Udemy to become
            more comfortable with this popular framework. I'm diving into RNNs
            and Reinforcement Learning and look forward to exploring more about
            them with SJSU's ML Club this semester.

          <h3>Stock Trading</h3>
          <p style="font-size: larger;">
            The possibility of generating side income from the stock market was
            always on my radar, and this summer I forced myself to sit down and
            learn about the complexities of the stock market, with a focus on
            technical analysis. I learned about all the terms, factors that push
            market movement, and reading candlestick charts and identifying
            common patterns. I focus on price action trading over the multi-day
            time frame and am currently developing and back testing trading
            strategies in my paper trading account in the NYSE, FOREX, and
            Options markets. Stocks keep me busy and serve as a constant
            reminder about life’s uncertainty. In the future, I aim to find a
            profitable trading plan and automate it!

          This may be one of the most difficult questions for anyone to answer,
          especially as a 20 year old still figuring themselves out. As of now,
          I largely believe on the importance of living a balanced life and
          enjoying the countless hours of work and consistency that goes into
          achieving long term goals. While college courses and my side quests
          take of most of my day, in my free time I like to unwind my playing
          basketball, exploring the outdoors with my friends, watching Netflix
          (currently watching The Lengend of Korra), and spending money on my
          setup and wardrobe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technologies magical capabilities and true exponential growth keeps in
          mind in awe, and I look forward to developing my craft this upcoming
          year and the many future decades I will have in the industry to
          produce impactful work. I’m proud to call myself a computer scientist
          and aim to give back to the community by sharing my knowledge as I
          continue growing myself.

                I created Reddit Clone, a full-stack application, for Mintbean's

                and desgined it using ANT Design. It features a posts wall and a

                posts and subreddits.
